MUHAMMAD: THE MAN AND HIS MESSAGE IN THE MODERN WORLD \r \r https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azRV6zSEXvo / 36. Surah An-Naazi,aat. Quran surah (79).\r \r I recommend you to watch every video start with 1 best. Then decide for yourself what you want to believe in. It doesn't matter who you are, how old you are, how you look, what race you have, what skin color, your social status, Man or Woman everything doesn't matter, it doesn't matter! This message is for everyone for all of humanity, to show you the truth.  It's up to you if you can accept it. you have your own will and your heart no one controls it. Your decision is for you alone. \r \r  \r You don't want to become a Muslim, even after you've watched all the videos no problem, you don't want to watch the videos no problem everyone can live as they want in islam there is no compulsion. but remember i  bring you the truth to save you. on judgment day you will not be able to say no one cleared me up, no one told me the truth i was influenced oh please forgive me, but then it is unfortunately already too late because this life is a Test and it ends with your death. oh Allah forgive us guid us ....\r \r Important if you have a problem with that things, that i say. blame me not Islam. Islam is perfect i´m not. If you strugle with the qestion, why i waste my time for this videos or similar, dont lie to your self. you waste already your time. The first thing that the Devil try is to bring you away from the truth to his way.\r Example you watch films, series, something on TV, play games and other things that pass the time. that bring you fun, but not everything that is fun is good for you. in the end you lose time. so you could think of these videos  from the links as a kind of series, wich is very exciting btw. and watch a video every day as an example, or every week as you like. in the end, even if you can't do anything with it, you have at least learned something about Islam one of the Bigest Religions in this world and the fast growing.  And you really can't see that as a waste of time, can you?  Why ? Because knowledge is power.  but remember the Devil and his follower will try everything to keep you away from this knowledge and to distract you with worldly things.\r  if you disagree with what I say and mark it as a lie prove to me that I am lying but pls watch first all videos that saves time.\r \r Of course you can  make kritik on me, for my bad grammar and English skills. I know that im not good at this,  but i hope i write it in a way, that you can it understand. Thats  the important thing. I know that my brother dont make this mistakes  he is a english,history teacher and make his Doctor and have much more knowledge than me. even at his acts he is better than me.  Maybe he laugh when he se this and see how bad my english is haha i will laugh with him. The point is im not my brother he have also his mistakes,  like me like you and every human being. Muslim, means,the one who submission to the will of Allah. Not that you a perfect person. \r In the eyes of Allah it is important how you behave and decide wath in your heart is, and not your reputation, your knowledge, your appearance, even if you are a King who looks good, who knows a lot and does good. A person who has nothing, doesn't look good, has little knowledge and does good; can be much higher in the eyes of Allah.\r \r Example Even if I did not believe in Allah and his Prophet, I would have to admit to myself, after all the knowledge I have acquired about Islam and all the things I have seen and heard, that Islam is the most logical and best way for people , Animals and this world.  Look at this beautiful world, how the animals, trees, all life lives in harmony with this planet and everything around this complex system that clearly comes in harmony and  how balance this exists.  And now look at the people we have Good and Bad , who are using this planet and acting in their favor, all of these bad qualities and not living in harmony. Where's The Justice, Why are it  The people who don't belong here and seem out of place. If You Come with a open mind and heart you will see that Islam is the only logical way that gives you the answer. At the End  you can belive in atheism, or evrey other Religion  for me its fine i have also non Muslim Friends and i respect every human i dont want to hurt anyone its your choice no one can force you stay with love ^^. \r \r Do you accept islam, do not think that you have to change your life completely now everything comes with time inshallah\r \r Inshallah means, so Allah wants, because nothing happens without his will\r https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgm3puP3tMA /The 99 Names of Allah.\r \r You only need take Shahada in Arabic and your language with full believe to become a Muslim: that is the seed that that you put. With time you give the seed water, thats the way .when you learn something ,thats your water, when you do something good ,thats  your water, when you follow the rules of Islam thats your water, when you pray thats your water,  that you give to the seed.  So your seed grows slowy with this inshallah, you will become a flower. Wath happen when you stop giving water to a flower ? so dont stop :) pray to Allah  guide me und you get never lost inshallah.>-", "date": "2020-12-24T19:33:25Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "Dhu l-Qarnain", "comment": "Unfortunately, that didn't make it into my comment because it is already too full ... Youtube makes real problems when it comes to that, if you want to post something that has so many links you often get an error and always have to change something, but that's another story. \r In these videos you can find out what will happen near the End and what will be one of the last great tests for humanity.\r \r  As Muslims we know that this time is very near. If you do all this knowing together you estimate that it will happen within the next 500 years, but only Allah knows when it will happen. The 1 video is important to know even for non-Muslims. Even if this probably won't happen in our generation, it is still important to have this knowledge.

Naruto had an army of clones train for weeks, essentially getting hundreds of years of training done in a short-ish time and he managed to create the 'Wind Style Rasenshuriken'.  I understand that the writers of Boruto don't want Boruto's generation to go through the same progression as their parents did. But still, I would've loved to see Boruto get some help with this, some advice that helps him or whatever. Instead Sasuke tells him to learn the Rasengan (and S-tier jutsu), Boruto tries once and manages to do the Rasengan AND add a change in chakra nature to it.  Honestly; just have him get some tips from Naruto, Sasuke or Kakashi or w/e and it would be a lot less frustrating. This is probably the best example of something that makes it feel like Naruto's generation didn't accomplish anything.  Rock Lee can open 5 gates before he even becomes a Chunin, because he spent a LOT of effort on this. Because of that I don't really care about Metal Lee opening 1 gate without as much training.", "date": "2020-10-28T04:25:58Z", "like": 1}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "神Madara Uchiha", "comment": "@Meemnat Ara Chowdhury what the fuk'-'", "date": "2020-10-26T14:59:43Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "Mubarkah Chaudhry", "comment": "Reasat Ullah 85 your a boruto lover and you hate naruto and might guy for working hard and hate them for being 1 of the best and loved characters might guy is best taijutsu user and speed and naruto is ninjitsu and speed", "date": "2020-10-09T20:05:31Z", "like": 1}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "Meemnat Ara Chowdhury", "comment": "You can't call Boruto's New Rasengan Rasenshuriken and Metal did train.

Sasuke also might not want to get an arm because even though he has a good amount of chakra the chakra absorption of the cells of hashirama is too much and would not allow Sasuke to fight properly.", "date": "2020-10-17T17:08:58Z", "like": 1}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "Eren Yeager", "comment": "What about DMS Kakashi?", "date": "2020-10-17T17:03:23Z", "like": 1}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "XWaspX", "comment": "@Rui Pires true", "date": "2020-10-12T17:41:36Z", "like": 1}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Matt Guerrero", "comment": "Can we take a moment to realize if madara wasn’t able to regenerate might guy would have beaten him and stopped the war at that second and avoid the whole laughs ordeal", "date": "2020-06-24T19:29:35Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "nguyen thanh", "comment": "Đỉnh cao của sự khổ luyện.

Gai was moving at blistering speed and therefore Madara had no time to use Susanoo even if he wanted to. Remember guy was running so fast in circles  Madara couldn't even see him?

That extra part about Gai's childhood and father was just too great of a tie in, kishimoto doing best what he does developing incredible short stories.   One qualm I have about all of this is that Gai definitely should have died, and not Jesus Naruto saving the day and if Naruto had these powers, he should have come in after Gai had died, so that you'd follow through the logic that 8 gates would kill you, especially at the intensity Gai used it up, and also it would fulfill his ultimate sacrifice emotional impact.   Just imagine Naruto showing up at the battlefront, Madara doesn't throw the 6 path orbs because he acknowledges Gai as dead, or soon to be dead, leaves him be, proceeds to main battlefield where everything is going on, and Naruto shows up to where kakashi is to only find out Gai's ultimate sacrifice only met with an ultimate failure. Naruto amped up more than ever heads to the battlefield, grabs Madara's head like Ichigo vs Aizen fight and slams him, that would set stage so amazingly.  If only kishimoto could transition his amazing side story to massively impact main characters in a meaningful way, instead of say Sasuke being a cringy little bitch even more and Naruto being less about being a savior than to actually learn pain is inevitable, but this is a kid's show and we shouldn't expect that much depth.", "date": "2019-06-06T14:11:44Z", "like": 2}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Jordan Gutierrez", "comment": "Lakas mo talaga guy sir sir sir sir sir sir sir", "date": "2019-06-06T08:35:38Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Obito Uchiha", "comment": "All dislikes are from madara.", "date": "2019-06-06T06:23:48Z", "like": 2}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "ああ", "comment": "ガイは俺の中の主人公。 Guy is the main character in me.", "date": "2019-06-05T14:05:05Z", "like": 10}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Jose Aponte", "comment": "the guy´s xrays going to the wrong side", "date": "2019-06-05T12:22:38Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "João Vinícius Oliveira", "comment": "Coitado do Gai morreu para arancar o braço do Madara", "date": "2019-06-05T00:05:41Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Runtoki", "comment": "That moment when you realize guy about to use an 8th dynamic entry on you and you try to yeet you're way out of it", "date": "2019-06-04T16:35:19Z", "like": 3}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Daniel Lindner", "comment": "At first I was afraid, I was afraid\r Down in the darkness I was crawling through the human race\r I heard the voices through the dark\r (oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)\r So I beat my fist against my chest against my heart  Hey-ho!\r Hear the sound\r We are the underground\r Hey-ho!\r Rising up\r We're not afraid of fighting  I've finally found my place\r I put the war paint on my face\r And I'm ready to give (hey!)\r whatever it takes\r Standing at the edge of the fire\r Fighting for the will to survive\r I feel it burning under my skin\r And I'm back on my feet again  This is the feeling\r I can't believe it\r My heart is bleeding out\r Now I'm dangerous\r  Feeding the fire\r Higher and higher\r Rising up, rising up\r Now I'm dangerous\r  Silence the voices in my head\r I picked my poison now I'll drink it to the bitter end\r Hey-ho!

Naruto and Sauske could have settled things out like they did and everything would have been better.
