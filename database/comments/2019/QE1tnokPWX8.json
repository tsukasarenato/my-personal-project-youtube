And that disappointment turns to bitterness. And then that bitterness gets a hold of you and you become someone not quite so good.  True virtue is being good and not expecting anything back.   A good man is not a weak man incapable of being bad. A good man is a strong man who chooses to be good anyway.   Find your inner monster. Everyone has one. In weak people,  its not noticeable,  but once they get a bit of power, it is. And they have no idea how to use it.  Harmless people are not good people. They've never been tested.   Find your inner monster and tame it. Stand up for yourself without letting the monster control you.   Be kind out of bravery. Be good because its right. And stand up for yourself.   Show yourself the same kindness you'd show others. Would you let others be treated the way you let yourself be? Would you judge others as harshly as you judge yourself?   Be strong, but don't let people mistreat you. I made that mistake,  and it brought out a very ugly side of me I never knew. I needed to realize I wasn't good. I was just scared to be anything else. I had to learn how to be good all over again once I realized this. I had to quit it with the self pitty and realize I really didn't deserve a reward for goodness if that's what I was doing it for.   I had to acknowledge the ugliness in me(my inner monster) and then face it. I had to learn how to be good because it was right, instead of good because it was all I had. I had to see myself clearly. And in order to do that, I Had to get outside of my head and find other things and people to focus on.   I still struggle with it, but I'm better off then when I was simply trying to be nice and wondering why that wasnt enough, and not knowing how to be anything else.", "date": "2021-01-29T00:43:29Z", "like": 1}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Litz _0xo", "comment": "omg i love it", "date": "2021-01-28T17:10:27Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "TheTypicalPerson114", "comment": "2:41 is it bad I find that part amusing and cool about battling", "date": "2021-01-26T18:48:06Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Shquaggle", "comment": "I don't understandddd  How do you AMV makers have so much fcking talent >:/", "date": "2021-01-26T15:50:07Z", "like": 1}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "InfernoRanger 61", "comment": "I've teared up 20 times just by watching this in 1 day 😢😥😄😪", "date": "2021-01-26T15:20:40Z", "like": 1}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Lord Vomapoo Comments", "comment": "If I had a theme song, this would be it.

Things related to MHA, things related to Izuku, things related to Karma, music in general, and my own mental health... that's why i kept pushing this off even though it kept showing up in my recommended.  I always said that one day I'd want to reclaim those things(The story overall is extremely personal, and I'm aware I'm probably not stealthy in my trying to hide it, I just don't like mentions of it from myself or others). I always said that, but because I'd been avoiding them so viscerally for so so long, I could never find a reason to. I guess this was some kind of a sign, or youtube reading my brain, because I've *been* trying to reclaim some things these past few days, but almost all of it was entirely in my head.  So, when despite several times telling youtube to not recommend this to me because now isn't the time and I don't want to see it, seeing it pop up yet again... I figured, why not?  And honestly? I'm glad I did. It's a good amv. It makes me want to try harder to get back to a place where I'm fully happy again. I want to see MHA and not feel uncomfortable because of personal situations again.

And that disappointment turns to bitterness. And then that bitterness gets a hold of you and you become someone not quite so good.  True virtue is being good and not expecting anything back.   A good man is not a weak man incapable of being bad. A good man is a strong man who chooses to be good anyway.   Find your inner monster. Everyone has one. In weak people,  its not noticeable,  but once they get a bit of power, it is. And they have no idea how to use it.  Harmless people are not good people. They've never been tested.   Find your inner monster and tame it. Stand up for yourself without letting the monster control you.   Be kind out of bravery. Be good because its right. And stand up for yourself.   Show yourself the same kindness you'd show others. Would you let others be treated the way you let yourself be? Would you judge others as harshly as you judge yourself?   Be strong, but don't let people mistreat you. I made that mistake,  and it brought out a very ugly side of me I never knew. I needed to realize I wasn't good. I was just scared to be anything else. I had to learn how to be good all over again once I realized this. I had to quit it with the self pitty and realize I really didn't deserve a reward for goodness if that's what I was doing it for.   I had to acknowledge the ugliness in me(my inner monster) and then face it. I had to learn how to be good because it was right, instead of good because it was all I had. I had to see myself clearly. And in order to do that, I Had to get outside of my head and find other things and people to focus on.   I still struggle with it, but I'm better off then when I was simply trying to be nice and wondering why that wasnt enough, and not knowing how to be anything else.", "date": "2021-01-29T00:43:14Z", "like": 1}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "Ash_Chan 2282", "comment": "Same but I start using it as a comfort song.", "date": "2020-11-28T14:45:16Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "Random Stuff", "comment": "Same", "date": "2020-11-23T14:38:35Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "Ok Boomer But It's a Cat", "comment": "Also I know these words have lost almost all meaning on the internet, but 4.2k likes is pretty poggers", "date": "2020-11-18T19:22:00Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "Ok Boomer But It's a Cat", "comment": "Oh my god I just realised..

So I'll just ramble about the things I liked especially  So happy you prettied up the mask at 0:22, it looks so good I wouldn't say build up but the feel from 2:18 to 3:06 felt soo good. You did fantastic with the last bit of the song, it sent such a strong message and broke my heart, I'm sure it's gonna be a tearjerker for some  This is probably the biggest jump in improvement you've had, I look forward to see how you can improve even more! also early access is epic", "date": "2019-06-30T10:04:01Z", "like": 138}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "XeminA -", "comment": "Psst Not A mask Its A Layer And Brightened Characters", "date": "2019-07-18T04:57:53Z", "like": 0}, {"is_replies": true, "author": "JustAnotherGuy", "comment": "CriticismCrow thank you for all your kind words and I hope this is tearjerker for some that’s the plan", "date": "2019-06-30T10:13:21Z", "like": 3}, {"is_replies": false, "author": "Seanthebomb", "comment": "EARLY ACCESS!
